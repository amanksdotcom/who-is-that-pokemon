We all remember the starting of Pokemon show, **Who's that Pokemon**. So I've tried get back the nostalgia by building a similar CLI guesser game using Python3

## Quick Start

Running the CLI tool is pretty simple

1. Clone the Repo
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:amanksingh99/who-is-that-pokemon.git
   ```
2. Change to Project directory
   ```
   cd who-is-that-pokemon
   ```
3. Create virtual env and install requirements
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   ```

## Tech Used

- Python 3
- PokeAPI Python Wrapper -> Pokebase
- Various python libraries to make CLI beautiful
